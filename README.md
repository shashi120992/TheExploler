# Notable Mentions

* **Replaced Default Health system by custom build health system which shows a health bar instead of heart**
* **Added XP points so that when a player meets required XP points he will be levelled up and his health will be restored.**
* **Added Kill count so that when a player kills an enemy it will be updated and increased by 10 points (Based on this kill count XP will be updated).**
* **When he destroys the destructible his health will be increased by 10 points**
* **For testing purposes added shortcuts. They are as follows**
    * L for Decrease Health
    * K for Increase health
    * Left Ctrl for Increase XP
* **Added Save and load system so that player can save his game and load that in his next sessions. For that I have used custom binary file encryption. And for cross platform support I have used Persistent Data Path**
